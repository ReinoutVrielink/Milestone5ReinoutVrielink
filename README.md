General Information:

This project investigates the historical evolution of the use of English loanwords,
also known as anglicisms, in the Dutch language. With this study I am aiming to trace the trajectory of the use of anglicisms,
and discern patterns in the development of this linguistic phenomenon. 
By studying literature and analysing television broadcasts from different time-periods, I am seeking to get a view of the linguistic patterns of the use of anglicisms.
With this research I will gain a broader understanding of language evolution, in particular the evolution of the Dutch language.


Research Question and Hypotheses:
How has the use of English loanwords in Dutch evolved over time?

Hypotheses:
The use of anglicisms in the Dutch language has increased over the last 40 years.
The increase however, is a slight one. It is not dangerous for the Dutch language.

Method:
I will conduct a literature review to identify important research and linguistic analyses. By analysing these sources
I am learning about the evolution of English loanwords in Dutch. I am also planning to conduct information by 
analyzing television broadcasts from over the years, and conduct information on whether the use of English loanwords increased or decreased in the last 40 years
